# THUMoodleWrapper

This is a simple moodle wrapper for moodle links of the THU(Technische Hochschule Ulm/University of Applied Science).  

## What does it do?

If you click on a [moodle-thu.de](https://moodle-thu.de) link the wrapper will open the moodle app instead of the browser.

## Requirements

* Android 5.0 or higher
* Official Moodle App installed
* THUMoodleWrapper installed

## Inspiration

I got inspired for this app by the following Project: [TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper](https://github.com/JonasBernard/TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper)  
Same as the Orignal Project the GPL-3.0 license applied to my Version.
